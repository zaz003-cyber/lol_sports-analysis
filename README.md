# Dragon Control and Victory in League of Legends
This is a DSC80 projectabout League of Legends Dragon Control and Match Outcome Analysis completed at UC San Diego. This project uses professional League of Legends match data to explore the relationship between mid-game key resources—particularly dragon control—and match outcomes.

In League of Legends, dragons are one of the core strategic objectives that shape the course of a match. Dragons with different attributes grant teams sustained buffs, and the “Dragon Soul” earned by collecting four dragons often significantly alters the game’s dynamics. This project analyzes whether dragon control advantage is more than just a reflection of overall economic lead, and whether it statistically correlates with match victories.

Based on professional match data from Oracle's Elixir, this project begins with exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing. It then constructs predictive models to assess the feasibility of forecasting match outcomes at the 15-minute mark using only mid-game information readily available in-game (such as dragon kill differential and economic gap). Finally, the project analyzes the fairness of these models.
